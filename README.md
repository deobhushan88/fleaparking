# Flea Parking
There are two parts to this repository:
* App <br/>*Bhushan Deo & Amod Rege*
* Backend <br/>*Gaurav Bhardwaj & Prabhu Siddharth Raveendran*

**Process**<br/>
Milestones, user stories for a sprint and bugs are tracked using the Github "issues" interface.<br/>
* Items related to the app, are to be labelled as "app"
* Items related to the backend, are to be labelled as "backend"
* Items related to 295b assignments are to be labelled as "295b"
* Items related to training are to be labelled as "training"
* Bugs will be labelled "bug"
* Enhancement suggestions will be labelled "enhancement"

Prior to beginning a sprint, we will plan and commit items to be completed in that sprint, using the milestones feature in Github.

Since we have small teams working independently on each component, we can do with simple source control management without branching:
* `git clone` this repository to get started
* Work on your code, commit locally with `git add` followed by `git commit` (with a proper, descriptive commit message).
* Then `git pull`! Resolve conflicts if any.
* Finally, after resolving any conflicts `git push` to this github repository.
